## üì° Data Sent to Backend

When a post is saved, the following JSON payload is sent via HTTP POST to the backend server:

```json
{
  "content": {
    "featured_image": "<featured_image_url>",
    "featured_image_credit": "<featured_image_caption>",
    "post_title": "Post Title",
    "post_link": "Post URL",
    "post_content": "Full post content HTML",
    "author_name": "Author Display Name",
    "post_date": "Scheduled date or N/a",
    "type": "slideshow or basic",
    "GUID": "WordPress post ID",
    "delete": true/false
  }
}
```

### Notes
- If the post is scheduled (`future` status), the scheduled date is sent in GMT.
- `delete: true` indicates the post should be removed from the feed.
